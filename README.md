## Hey, how's it goin'? I'm Marc Pickelman, a born and raised Yooper, livin' in South Dakota, and learnin' how to code. ðŸ’»

Now, I know what you're thinking...
What is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us.
... Let me start over...
A Yooper is an Upper, as in, a person from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a land of woods and bogs, surrounded by three out of the five Great Lakes. It's about an hour from any lake at any point in the U.P. (Upper Peninsula). But, right now, I'm living in South Dakota. I traded the Great Lakes for the Great Plains; and the only Great Lake an hour away from me is the big, blue sky above. Roughly an hour. Maybe two.

Anywho, I am a Recreation and Programming Specialist for Parks, Recreation, and Forestry for the City of Harrisburg, S.D., and a Full Stack Developer/Software Engineer in training. Currently, I work to develop the programming side of Parks and Rec for Harrisburg by offering recreational opportunities for children, adults, and seniors. What I strive to do is re-enter the Digital workforce to provide for my family. After College, I became an SEO Specialist for a local SEO company. After that, I became a teacher and a tradesman. Now, the Digital World has called me back.
In November of 2024, I enrolled in a software engineer bootcamp offered by TripleTen. Since then, I have learned HTML5, CSS3, basic JavaScript, flexbox, grid layout, BEM, Media queries, transition, CSS animations, DOM, debugging, Git, GitHub, and Figma. From being an SEO Specialist, I learned LSI (latent semantic indexing), geotagging, GBP (Google Business Profile, formerly GMB, Google My Business), Google Drive, Google Search Console, Google Analytics 3 (achieving all GA3 Certificates), Google Analytics 4, and used SEMRush, Ahrefs, theXifer, and other online tools. I also attended a leadership course offered by The Growth Coach and was a member of BNI (Business Network International). From my other work experiences, I have learned to be a better leader and team player, as well as a real Renaissance Man, or, Jack of All Trades.

Nevertheless, God has a plan for my life. All I have to do is show up.
The Road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the Road has gone, and I must follow, if I can.
Ad maiorem Dei gloriam. Ora et labora. Nascantur in admiratione.
