## Hey, how's it going? I'm Marc Pickelman, a Midwesterner training to become a Software Engineer. ðŸ’» It's nice to meet you.

After branching off from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) back in 2022, the digital world has called me back. As of November of 2024, I have enrolled in and am undergoing a Software Engineering Bootcamp offered by TripleTen. 

Since then, I have learned HTML5, CSS3, basic JavaScript, flexbox, grid layout, BEM, Media queries, transition, CSS animations, DOM, debugging, Git, GitHub, and Figma. From my former SEO experience, I understand and am familiar with LSI (latent semantic indexing), geotagging, GBP (Google Business Profile, formerly GMB, Google My Business), Google Drive, Google Search Console, Google Analytics 3 (achieved all GA3 Certificates), Google Analytics 4, SEMRush, Ahrefs, theXifer, and other online tools.

I've attended a leadership course, called, The Growth Coach, was a member of Business Network International (BNI), and currently lead a men's group.

I am also married to a beautiful South Dakotan woman. We have three small and wonderful children all under the age of 4. I have a Bachelor's in English Literature. I'm an avid reader. I love Tolkien, Shakespeare, Chaucer, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Howard Pyle, Robert Frost, etc. etc., and all the Anonymous Authors and Poets of yore.
