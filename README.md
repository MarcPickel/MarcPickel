I'm interested in providing real solutions for real, hard-working people. 🛠️ I grew up in an entrepreneurial family and worked alongside blue-collar men and women every day who poured out their heart and soul through blood, sweat, and tears to bring home that hard-earned paycheck for their families. I've worked in Search Engine Optimization 🌟 and as an Apprentice Electrician ⚡, Mower 🌱, Park Technician 🌳, etc.

Natural languages have always fascinated me. Naturally, computer languages were next in my linguistic fascination. Now, I'm honing them to provide the best service possible for the best people.
